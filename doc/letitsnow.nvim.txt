1. letitsnow.nvim                              *letitsnow.nvim-letitsnow.nvim*

A Neovim plugin written in Lua to bring winter "hygge" into your editor.


BUT WHY?                              *letitsnow.nvim-letitsnow.nvim-but-why?*

Image this: It is winter. You are sitting in the evening by the fireplace and
candlelight coding away. But suddenly you get stuck on a difficult problem.
While sitting there and wondering how you will ever solve this problem, your
code is just sitting there, staring you in the face. Wouldn’t it be nice if
you could bring some of the winter cozyness into your editor? This is the
vision of _letitsnow.nvim_. _letitsnow.nvim_ attempts to solve this by letting
it snow directly in your editor, bringing some fluffyness into your code.


INSTALLATION                      *letitsnow.nvim-letitsnow.nvim-installation*

>lua
    {
        "marcussimonsen/letitsnow.nvim",
        cmd = "LetItSnow" -- Wait with loading until command is run
        opts = {},
    }

HOW TO RUN                          *letitsnow.nvim-letitsnow.nvim-how-to-run*

The only function available in _letitsnow.nvim_ is `LetItSnow` which is meant
to *help bring you some "hygge" into your editor :)
