1. let-it-snow.nvim                        *let-it-snow.nvim-let-it-snow.nvim*

A Neovim plugin written in Lua to bring winter "hygge" into your editor.


BUT WHY                            *let-it-snow.nvim-let-it-snow.nvim-but-why*

Imagine this: It is winter. You are sitting in the evening by the fireplace and
candlelight coding away. But suddenly you get stuck on a difficult problem.
While sitting there and wondering how you will ever solve this problem, your
code is just sitting there, staring you in the face. Wouldn’t it be nice if
you could bring some of the winter cozyness into your editor? This is the
vision of `let-it-snow.nvim`. `let-it-snow.nvim` attempts to solve this by
letting it snow directly in your editor, bringing some fluffyness into your
code.


HOW TO RUN                      *let-it-snow.nvim-let-it-snow.nvim-how-to-run*

The only function available in `let-it-snow.nvim` is `LetItSnow` which is meant
to *help bring you some "hygge" into your editor :) Oh and when the snow has
piled up too much `EndHygge` will be available to save your code from being
burried in the snow. Alternatively, just call `LetItSnow` again in the same
buffer.


INSTALLATION                  *let-it-snow.nvim-let-it-snow.nvim-installation*

>lua
    {
        "marcussimonsen/let-it-snow.nvim",
        cmd = "LetItSnow", -- Wait with loading until command is run
        opts = {},
    }

CONFIGURATION                *let-it-snow.nvim-let-it-snow.nvim-configuration*

`let-it-snow.nvim` uses the following default values. Use the `opts` table
where you install the plugin or pass a table to the setup function to overwrite
settings.

>lua
    {
        ---@type integer Delay between updates
        delay = 500,
        ---@type string Single character used to represent snowflakes
        snowflake_char = "\u{2744}",
        ---@type string[] Array of single character used to represent snow (in order of least to most)
        snowpile_chars = {
            [1] = "\u{2581}",
            [2] = "\u{2582}",
            [3] = "\u{2583}",
            [4] = "\u{2584}",
            [5] = "\u{2585}",
            [6] = "\u{2586}",
            [7] = "\u{2587}",
            [8] = "\u{2588}",
        },
        ---@type integer Max attempts at spawning a snowfile
        max_spawn_attempts = 500,
        ---@type boolean Whether to create highlight groups or not
        create_highlight_groups = true,
        ---@type string Name of namespace to use for extmarks (you probably don't need to change this)
        namespace = "let-it-snow",
        ---@type string Name of highlight group to use for snowflakes
        highlight_group_name_snowflake = "snowflake",
        ---@type string Name of highlight group to use for snowpiles
        highlight_group_name_snowpile = "snowpile",
    }
