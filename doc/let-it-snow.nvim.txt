A Neovim plugin written in Lua to bring winter "hygge" into your editor.


BUT WHY?                          *let-it-snow.nvim-let-it-snow.nvim-but-why?*

Image this: It is winter. You are sitting in the evening by the fireplace and
candlelight coding away. But suddenly you get stuck on a difficult problem.
While sitting there and wondering how you will ever solve this problem, your
code is just sitting there, staring you in the face. Wouldn’t it be nice if
you could bring some of the winter cozyness into your editor? This is the
vision of _let-it-snow.nvim_. _let-it-snow.nvim_ attempts to solve this by
letting it snow directly in your editor, bringing some fluffyness into your
code.
